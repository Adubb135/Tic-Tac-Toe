## History of Tic-Tac-Toe

An early variation of the game was played in Rome **WAAAYYY** back in the older age!  
It was called "terni lapilli", which means "three pebbles at a time". This game was even played  
in the Ancient Egyptian ruins!


## What Is Tic-Tac-Toe?
The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid or four in a row in a 4-by-4 grid.   
To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares, usually 3-by-3.  
In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.


## Creating The Game!
Whelp, this the beginning! I don't have a gameplan just yet, **BUT** will make sure to update this page once I start going!  

Til Then, *Au Revoir!*
